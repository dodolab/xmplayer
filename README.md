# XM PLAYER

Serverless player for XM tracker files. Contains a simple UI and XM engine, both written in *TypeScript*.

Uses ParcelJS for bundling.

**Budget: ~150 hours of work.**

## Installation
* create folder `assets/mods` and move your own files to this directory (**only files with XM extension are supported**). 
* type `npm install`
* type `npm start`
* `scripts/generate_files.js` script is a NodeJS script that will go through all your XM files and create `files.json`. This file will be used by the UI player to select random files to play.
* connect to `localhost:1234/index.html`
* if you wanna build the whole project, run `npm run build`

## Architecture

* `UI` is very simple, uses WebCanvas and `Player` from `xmlib`
* `Player` uses `WebAudioAPI` for biquad filters and the `ScriptProcessorNode` for filling the output buffer. Everything else (including envelopes and effects) is implemented manually.
* `XMFile` is a structure of XM File
* `Parser` parses XM File from a binary file
* `Tracker` advances a context after each tick
* `Processor` is a sound processing engine
* `Mixer` mixes two channels and handles loops
* `Effects` contains implementation of effects as specified by XM format

## UI description

* UI is still work in progress. For now, only basics data is provided
* Max number of channels displayed is 6. XM format can have up to 32, though.

## XM File structure

* Not sure if this is 100% correct. Original documentation can be found [here.](http://ftp.modland.com/pub/documents/format_documentation/FastTracker%202%20v2.04%20(.xm).html)

## TODO

* portamento doesn't sound properly for several tracks
* UI could benefit from certain attention
* not all effects are implemented
* big endian architectures are not yet supported
